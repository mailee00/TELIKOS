        <p>So, I wanted to show some pictures and a brief description of my thought process when I'm designing. <br> I've decided to go with an older character of mine who's in desparate need of a redesign. With all characters, I start by throwing together a moodboard with all the elements I want to include or ideas that I want to explore. <br><br>This character is transported from a modern world to a steampunk one. Because everything happened suddenly, I wanted her to retain some pieces from her world in her look. I explored ideas like the kind of clothes she would've been in the moment she was taken and the pieces of clothing she adopted on her journey. My idea for this character was centered around the idea of "a plain jane protagonist being unwittingly pulled into an adventure.</p>

        <p>From here I just start laying out ideas. I thought it would be funny if she was taking out the trash when the fabric of the universe tore open, so I decided she should be dressed very comfortably. I tried different hairstyles and settled on curly brown hair to really sell her "averageness." I also played with ideas like the kind of shirt she would be wearing. What do we usually wear in our homes? An old school tee? A raggedy tourist shirt your aunt brought you back from her cruise in the Bahamas? I settled on a school shirt with a mallard for a mascot. Something like a bear would be too... fierce. I wanted the viewer's subconscious to be like, "Wow... She's kinda plain." </p>

        <p> I explored two different looks for her outfit. I settle on the left one because it's more cohesive overall. It retained the "caught-off-guard" vibe with the mismatched socks and crocs, but the outfit still maintains a sort of consistency with the colors. The steampunk corset and bag attachment are also more adventure-y than the design tested on the right.<br><br>Some designs call for more attention than others, but this is the short version of my design process!</p>
