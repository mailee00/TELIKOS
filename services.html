          <p>1-hour long consulation to review your character's description and important aesthetic elements. We will discuss their background, setting, and other relevant details that influence their look. Together, we will work to complete a <b>Written</b> Character Style Sheet.</p>

          <p>Designing</p>
          <p>We will take the written style sheet and convert it to a visual format. We'll explore some ideas from the sheet, talk about color theory, and settle on a practical design for your character. By the end, you will have a <b>Drawn</b> Character Style Sheet for your personal reference.</p>

      <div id="tabs-1"><b>Consultation</b> - This stage is alllll about writting down the important details. Granted, you already have a basic idea of what your character looks like. But, there are some parts of a design that may be unspoken. Be extremely descriptive and think about the features that define them.<br><br>Do they have a scar from a bike accident in their youth? Do they bite their nails as part of some nervous tic? Are they attentive to their clothes? (Untied shoelaces? Wrinkled shirt?) Do they work inside all day? (Are they pale because of it?) All these seemingly mundane things can make a character unique when they add up.</div>
      <div id="tabs-2"><b>Designing, Pt.1</b> - In the drafting stage, we sketch out a few different looks for particular elements. We look at physical characteristics like hair style and hair color or different outfit styles. Being attentive to the style of an outfit can help sell a character’s personality, even if their facial characteristics remain the same. A flowing dress with a scoop neckline can make a character seem more innocent, because of the soft lines. Angular cuts like a sheath dress with a square neckline can make your character seem more confident or intimidating.</div>
      <div id="tabs-3"><b>Designing, Pt.2</b> - In this last stage, we settle on the elements we want to use for the final design (or designs if we’re looking at multiple outfits). Each piece has been thoughtfully chosen and we’re left with a visually appealing and practical design!</div>
